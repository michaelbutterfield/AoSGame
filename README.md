- **Dice Management**: Comprehensive dice rolling system with AoS-specific rolls and physical dice simulation
- **Input Management**: Camera control, unit selection, movement, measurement, dice rolling, phase progression, command point tracker toggle, unit abilities toggle
- **Army Building**: Unit database, point system (2000 points), army composition rules, save/load functionality, regiments of renown support

- **Unit Abilities System**: Comprehensive unit and model abilities with effects, conditions, and activation phases
- **Radius Indicator System**: Visual radius indicators for buffs, debuffs, and auras with customizable templates and effects

### Radius Indicator System

The Radius Indicator System provides visual feedback for unit abilities that affect other units within specific ranges. This is perfect for abilities like the Megaboss's "+1 to charge rolls within 12\"" or the Nighthaunt's "-1 bravery within 3\"".

**Key Features:**

- **Visual Radius Indicators**: Transparent colored circles showing the range of unit abilities
- **Customizable Templates**: Different visual styles for buffs, debuffs, auras, and terrain-dependent effects
- **Dynamic Effects**: Pulsing animations, emission effects, and range text labels
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatic classification of indicators by type (buff, debuff, aura, terrain)
- **Interactive Management**: Toggle visibility, filter by type, and manage individual unit indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Indicators automatically follow units and update positions
- **Range Validation**: Built-in methods to check which units are affected by specific abilities

**Indicator Types:**

- **Charge Buff** (Green): +1 to charge rolls, e.g., Megaboss Waaagh! aura
- **Save Buff** (Blue): +1 to save rolls, e.g., Freeguild General discipline
- **Bravery Buff** (Yellow): +1 to bravery, e.g., General leadership auras
- **Bravery Debuff** (Red): -1 to bravery, e.g., Nighthaunt spectral terror
- **Aura** (Orange): General magical effects, e.g., spell casting bonuses
- **Terrain Dependent** (Cyan): Effects that require terrain proximity

**Controls:**

- **R**: Toggle all radius indicators
- **B**: Toggle buff radius indicators
- **V**: Toggle debuff radius indicators
- **T**: Toggle terrain-dependent indicators
- **Y**: Toggle aura indicators

**Usage Examples:**

```csharp
// Create a charge buff indicator (e.g., Megaboss +1 to charge rolls within 12")
var chargeIndicator = radiusManager.CreateChargeBuffIndicator(megaboss, 12.0f);

// Create a bravery debuff indicator (e.g., Nighthaunt -1 bravery within 3")
var braveryIndicator = radiusManager.CreateBraveryDebuffIndicator(knightOfShrouds, 3.0f);

// Create a custom aura indicator
var customIndicator = radiusManager.CreateAuraIndicator(wizard, 18.0f, "+1 to spell casting");

// Check which units are affected by a buff
var affectedUnits = radiusManager.GetUnitsInBuffRange(sourceUnit, "Charge");
```
